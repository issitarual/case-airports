# Case Machine Learning Engineer - Airpoirts delay
## About üîé
This is an API wich you can preview a flight delay using a Machine Learn model.

### Implemented features ‚úÖ
- [x] Notebook with questions answeared with pyspark, model and the final question related to enrich the database
- [x] Model .pkl file
- [x] API health endpoint
- [x] Load model endpoint
- [x] User the model to make a prediction endpoint
- [x] Show model prediction history endpoint
- [x] Add tests related to each endpoint
- [x] Refactor the code
### Future improvements üîÆ
- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Improve model metrics

| <kbd>POST /model/predict/</kbd>     | Receives a payload with flight information and returns the estimated delay at the destination
| <kbd>POST /model/load/</kbd>     | Receives the model and leave the API ready to make predictions
| <kbd>GET /model/history/</kbd>     | Displays the history of predictions made (the input payload + the predicted outputs)
| <kbd>GET /health/</kbd>     | Returns the health of the API
